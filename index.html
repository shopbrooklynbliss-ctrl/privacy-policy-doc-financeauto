    <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> When you connect your social media account(s) (e.g., Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube), we collect authentication tokens to securely post content on your behalf. These tokens allow us to access your account to perform the actions you’ve authorized.</li>

    We use your data solely to provide the services that you have requested, including but not limited to the following:
  </p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform Integrations:</strong> We share necessary data with social media platforms (such as Pinterest) solely for the purpose of posting content, scheduling posts, and collecting analytics.
